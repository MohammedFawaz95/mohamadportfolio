         <h2>My motivation </h2>
         <p>
           To begin with, my name is Mohammed F. Almadhoun, I have graduated from Gaza training college (GTC) Electronic and Automated control, where I learned a lot about programming,
           I have courses in many programming languages C#, C++ and Java. I loved programming after being exposed to it while I was studying it at college, therefor I have intended to continue in this field.

           I have started studying some online courses to be a front-end developer, and I have been so passionate about it. I already have the basics that I learned in College.

           After some research, I found that JavaScript is considered one of the best languages and many great frameworks like React are built upon it.

           I saw the advertisement and thought it would be amazing to participate in such a program, I believe that collaborative learning is way more useful and affective and will make the participants push each other forward, and the best part that the program will be focusing on JavaScript as a front end and a back-end language which is exactly what Iâ€™m looking for.

           I will be committed to this program believing that If I had this chance it will be the big next thing in my professional life and my career.
